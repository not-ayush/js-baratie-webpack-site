          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          The Baratie was founded 12 years ago by the renowned former pirate captain, Zeff. After a fateful encounter on the high seas that left him
          and a young boy stranded for 85 days, Zeff sold all his treasure to purchase this unique floating restaurant. His vision: to create a haven
          where all seafarers, regardless of their background, could enjoy exquisite cuisine. <br /> <br />
          From humble beginnings, the Baratie has grown into the East Blue's premier floating restaurant, expanding to include multiple decks and even
          sister ships. <br />

            <li>Lively atmosphere with occasional 'dinner shows' (usually involving rowdy pirates being taught table manners)</li>
            <li>A chance to challenge our chefs to a culinary duel (but be prepared to wash dishes if you lose!)</li>
